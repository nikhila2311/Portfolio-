Overflow:hidden
Imagine a Water Tank
You have a water tank (the container), and you keep pouring water (content) into it.
If the tank overflows, water will spill out.
Now in the digital world:

The tank is a div or any HTML element.
The water is the content inside it (like text, images, or other elements).
If the content is larger than the container, it will overflow just like water does.
How overflow: hidden; Works:
Setting overflow: hidden; is like putting a lid on the tankâ€”even if there's too much content, it won't spill out. Instead, anything that doesnâ€™t fit is hidden

For absolute and position
Think of a Classroom ðŸ“š
The classroom floor represents the webpage.
Desks represent containers (divs or sections on the webpage).
Sticky notes represent the elements you want to position (like images or buttons).
position: relative;
Imagine a sticky note attached to a desk, but you decide to shift it slightly within that desk.

Key Point: The sticky note stays connected to the desk and moves based on its original spot within the desk. If the desk moves, the sticky note moves with it.

position: absolute;
Now imagine you detach the sticky note from any desk and stick it directly on the classroom wall.

Key Point: The sticky note ignores the desk layout and is positioned exactly where you specify within the classroom (or the nearest parent container with position: relative;).
